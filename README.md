# üìò Wikipedia Watchlist Automation (Playwright + TypeScript)

This project automates the process of managing a Wikipedia watchlist using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) with TypeScript and Page Object Model (POM).

## üåü What This Test Does

- Logs into a Wikipedia user account
- Adds two specific articles to the watchlist
- Removes one of the articles via the "Edit your list of watched pages" feature
- Verifies that the other article still exists in the watchlist
- Validates that the article's title matches when visiting it

## üíª Tech Stack

- [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/)
- TypeScript
- Page Object Model (POM)
- Cross-browser testing (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)
- Accessible locators (e.g., `getByRole`, `getByLabel`)
